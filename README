Dropvault helps you synchronize your files between your different devices.

The web application provides a WebDAV endpoint for you to push your files,
and is intended to be used as a mount point on your computer.

The android application keeps a local copy of the shared folder and allows
you to access your files even when your phone is offline.

All files are encrypted by the server side storage engine. The key to decrypt
all files is your password, and it isn't stored in clear in the application.
This makes you the only one able to decrypt and download your files.
